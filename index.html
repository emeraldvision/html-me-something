                    This memoir of Poehler's made me have even more appreciation
                    for a person I already admired. She is charming, honest,
                    funny, and clever.

                    This series is thrilling and thoughtful. Even though the
                    dystopian future it imagines is fiction, the themes are
                    relevant to today's world.

                    Mendelson's book is the result of her research into a topic
                    that she recognized was not represented in modern literature. 
                    Missing the housekeeping books from generations past, 
                    Mendelson created this tome to address domestic tasks in an 
                    era of dishwashers, computers, and other technology.
